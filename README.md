# Deforestation Exploration
This project is an analysis of deforestation around the world, aimed at helping the non-profit organization ForestQuery reduce deforestation and raise awareness on this important environmental issue. The report is divided into five sections that provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of deforestation and its impact on global ecosystems.

## Introduction
The first section of the report provides an overview of the project and its objectives. It outlines the goals of ForestQuery and its leadership team, who are seeking to understand which countries and regions around the world have the most significant forest area, and which ones have been experiencing deforestation in recent years. By analyzing this data, the team hopes to develop initiatives, allocate resources, and raise awareness to reduce deforestation.

## Instructions
The second section of the report provides a brief explanation of the report's purpose and structure. It includes instructions for creating a report that explains the results of the analysis using complete sentences. The report is divided into five sections, each of which corresponds to a different aspect of deforestation: Global Situation, Regional Outlook, Country-Level Detail, Recommendations, and an Appendix of SQL queries used.

## Global Situation
The third section of the report provides a review of the state of deforestation on a global scale. It analyzes data from 1990 to 2016 to identify trends in forest area and deforestation rates around the world. The section provides a comprehensive overview of the situation, explaining the main factors driving deforestation, and its impact on global ecosystems.

## Regional Outlook
The fourth section of the report focuses on an analysis of deforestation by region. It examines deforestation rates across different regions of the world, highlighting similarities and differences between them. By analyzing regional trends, the report aims to identify areas that require the most urgent attention to reduce deforestation rates.

## Country-Level Detail
The fifth section of the report breaks down deforestation by country. It provides a detailed analysis of deforestation rates and trends in individual countries, identifying the countries with the highest deforestation rates, and those that have managed to reduce their rates of deforestation over time. This information will be useful for identifying the areas where ForestQuery can focus its efforts to reduce deforestation.

## Recommendations
The sixth and final section of the report provides recommendations based on the analysis conducted in the previous sections. It highlights areas where ForestQuery can allocate resources to have the most significant impact on reducing deforestation rates and conserving global ecosystems. The section provides a set of actionable recommendations that can be used by the organization to guide its efforts going forward.

## Appendix: SQL Queries Used
The report includes an appendix that lists the SQL queries used to obtain the data for the analysis. The queries can be used by others to replicate the analysis or to explore the data in more detail.

In conclusion, this report provides a comprehensive analysis of deforestation trends around the world, with a focus on identifying areas where ForestQuery can allocate resources to have the most significant impact. By providing a detailed overview of deforestation rates and trends by region and country, the report helps the organization to make informed decisions and develop effective strategies for reducing deforestation.
